# Example Jesse Strategies

The point of this repository is to host examples of different types of strategies that you can implement with Jesse to get you started. 

## Submission guide

All submitted strategies must be heavily documented. Try to use lots of comments! 
Provide information on symbols and timeframes they work on / were tested.


## Usage Guide
Just copy the folder into your Jesse project's `strategies` directory, and select them in the backtest tab.

Be aware that these are examples to show different approaches to code strategies, use different indicators and functions of Jesse.

The aim of this repository is NOT to provide ready-to-go profitable strategies, but code examples.

The strategies might only work on certain timeframes / symbols. On others, you might face exceptions and need to do adjustments.

Possible things that can happen for example: 
- `Uncaught Exception: InvalidStrategy: qty cannot be 0`: This is related to precision and rounding. Different coins have different price precision leading to necessary adjustments to the qty logic. For example it might be necessary to increase the precision of Jesse's qty utility functions. 
- No trades: You might be using a timeframe or symbol where the signals don't work / happen.
- "It's not profitable": That's not the aim of those strategies and besides that this depends on symbol, timeframe, indicators parameters and much more factors.
